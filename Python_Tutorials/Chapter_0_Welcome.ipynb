I've noticed that as I've written these tutorials, Gemini will read my text and then automatically produce sample Python code once I create a Code Cell. Most of the time, Gemini does a pretty good job of \"understanding\" my intention and writing code that I would have written. It's actually pretty amazing.\n",

        "\n",

        "* **Desireable struggle**: When a task is hard enough to force you to actively retrieve, reason, and problem-solve, but not so hard that you get stuck in frustration.\n",
        "* **Overload:** If the challenge is too high (too much cognitive load), you can shut down, feel lost, or just copy without understanding.\n",
        "* **Underload**: If the challenge is too low (everything done for you), you don‚Äôt engage deeply, so nothing sticks.\n",
        "\n",
